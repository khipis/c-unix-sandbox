# Shift-registers

LFSR: In computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.

A5/1: is a stream cipher used to provide over-the-air communication privacy in the GSM cellular telephone standard. It is one of seven algorithms which were specified for GSM use.


Geffe: Pseudo-random generator Designed By P.R. Geffe  based on interconnected nonlinear three registers LFSR. 

Stop and go: proposed by CG Gunther in 1987. As the Geffe algorithm, was built with three LFSR's. It is based on the timing clock.

Shrinker: Very fast pseudo-random generator.
